####EhCache Effective Caching: How-To
##Recipe 11 (EhCache & Terracotta Server Array)

In this recipe you will be shown how to integrate EhCache and Terracotta Server Array. We will take advantage of the seamless integration that the Terracotta team has provided to developers wanting to enable EhCache in a distributed environment.  

Surprisingly as it may sound, the programmatic approach is no different than the standalone approach. It is just a matter of configuring EhCache correctly in your application and you will scale appropriately.
