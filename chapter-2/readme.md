author: <daniel.wind.m@gmail.com>

EhCache-Effective-Caching Book Source Code

In this chapter we will cover the following topics:

* Getting EhCache Library
* Integrating Ehcache in Maven Project
* Declarative Configuration through XML
* Programmatic Configuration through CacheConfiguration Class

---
_If you do not want to use Maven (or your project simply does not require it), EhCache library can be obtained directly from their official website <http://ehcache.org/downloads/catalog> (as of writing of this book), in which you will want to download ehcache-2.6.0-distribution.tar.gz (current version as of this writing). You can also see the additional modules section which we will be visiting frequently as you progress in this book._
