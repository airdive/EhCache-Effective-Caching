************************************************

In this chapter we will cover the following topics: 

* Getting EhCache Library
* Integrating Ehcache in Maven Project
* Declarative Configuration through XML
* Programmatic Configuration through CacheConfiguration Class
* Programmatic Configuration through Annotations

* If you do not want to use Maven (or your project simply does not require it), EhCache library can be obtained directly from their official website http://ehcache.org/downloads/catalog, in which you will want to download ehcache-2.6.0-distribution.tar.gz (current version as of this writing). You can also see the additional modules section which we will be visiting frequently as you progress in this book.
